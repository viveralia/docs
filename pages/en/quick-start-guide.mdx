[Fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com/) is a device intelligence platform that helps businesses protect their applications from fraud, account takeover, spam, bots, and other malicious activity. Fingerprint capabilities include:

- [**Visitor identification**](https://fingerprint.com/products/identification/): Recognize returning browsers and mobile devices with industry-leading accuracy, without relying on cookies or IP addresses. Every visitor gets a visitor ID like `e0srMXYG7PjFCAbE0yIH` that cannot be deleted, lasts much longer than a cookie, and stays the same even if the visitor uses incognito mode or a VPN.
- [**Smart signals**](https://fingerprint.com/products/smart-signals/): Detect suspicious device configurations like bots, VPN users, tampered browsers, or jailbroken phones with our actionable device intelligence insights.

In this guide, we will quickly get you started identifying your visitors using Fingerprint so you can test it out yourself. If you would like a practical demo of Fingerprint capabilities first, see our [Playground](https://demo.fingerprint.com/playground) or explore [Use cases](https://demo.fingerprint.com/). If you want a deeper understanding of our platform, see [Introduction](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/introduction).

## 1. Create an account

1. [Sign up for your free trial](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/signup?utm_source=https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/quick-start-guide) to get started, no credit card is required.
2. You can choose to store all your Fingerprint data in the United States, Germany, or India. See [Regions](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions) for more information.

## 2. Get your API Key

1. In the Dashboard, navigate to [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/api-keys) in the left-hand menu.
2. Under **Public Keys**, copy or save your public API key to run the examples below.

If you've just created your account, please allow a minute or two for your API key to propagate before using it.

## 3. Add the client-side agent

Once you've created your account and got your public API key, you can [add the JavaScript agent](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/install-the-javascript-agent) to your website or add a native SDK to your [iOS](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/ios) or [Android app](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/native-android-integration). The agent collects browser or device attributes, sends them to the Fingerprint backend, and receives a **visitor ID** for that browser or mobile device.

The easiest way to add the agent is by going to the [**SDKs & integrations**](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/integrations) page and picking your preferred web or mobile library.

For example, you can install the JavaScript agent loader as an NPM package:

```shell NPM
npm install @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro
```
